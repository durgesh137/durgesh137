# Durgesh Kumar — Principal Developer ☕️🚀
Principal Developer · Cloud-native microservices · FinTech & Enterprise Systems  
Architecting secure, fault-tolerant distributed systems and driving engineering excellence across the full product lifecycle.

---
> Principal Developer with 6+ years of progressive experience delivering scalable, cloud-native microservices for FinTech and large enterprise systems. Proven track record designing end-to-end platforms, mentoring teams, and improving engineering quality (92%+ SonarQube compliance). Passionate about digital identity, privacy, and decentralized protocols.

## Core strengths
- 🏗️ System architecture & microservices: Spring Boot (2.x/3.x), Spring, Hibernate, Spring Data JPA  
- ☕ Modern Java: Java 8 / 11 / 17 / 21 (streams, CompletableFuture, records, modules)  
- ☁️ Cloud & Containers: Azure, AWS (EC2, S3, Secrets), AKS/EKS, Docker, Key Vault  
- 🛰️ Data & streaming: Kafka (Avro), MongoDB, MySQL, Redis, GridFS  
- ✅ DevOps & quality: CI/CD (Jenkins, GitHub Actions), SonarQube (92%+ compliance), Dynatrace, Splunk  
- 🧪 Testing & practices: JUnit5, Mockito, TDD/BDD, code reviews, design patterns

## Impact & highlights
- 🔁 Led migration of a legacy C++ monolith to a cloud-native, event-driven Spring Boot microservices platform — improved scalability and substantially reduced technical debt.  
- ⚡ Designed Kafka-based streaming for real-time processing, handling **1M+ customer records/month** and enabling robust, low-latency business flows.  
- 🛠️ Architected AKS-based auto-scaling deployments with mature CI/CD enabling **99.9% uptime** and zero-downtime releases.  
- 🧹 Enforced DevOps and code governance to achieve and sustain **92%+ SonarQube compliance**; reduced critical defects by **35%** in under three months.  
- 👥 Mentored 4+ engineers and drove a **20%** improvement in PR merge success and overall engineering throughput.

## How I work
- 🗺️ Define technical roadmaps aligned to product goals and SLAs; translate requirements into measurable engineering outcomes.  
- 🔎 Prioritize observability and resilience: tracing, metrics, alerting, and automated health checks.  
- 🧰 Advocate engineering hygiene via CI/CD, automated quality gates (Sonar), test automation, and rigorous code reviews.  
- 🧩 Prefer incremental, telemetry-driven improvements and focused refactors over large, risky rewrites.

## Typical architecture pattern
Event-driven microservices + Kafka (Avro) for reliable streaming, Spring Boot for business logic, MongoDB/MySQL for persistence, AKS/EKS for orchestration, CI/CD with automated quality gates. 🏷️
